# Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Tourism in New Zealand

## Project Description:

This project examines the trends and relationships between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, tourism, and climate change in New Zealand from 1990 to 2020. The project uses data from various sources, including the Our World in Data, the New Zealand Government Data Catalogue, and the IMF Climate Change. The project employs various data analysis techniques, including **descriptive statistics**, **correlation and regression analysis**, **hypothesis testing**, and **predictive modeling using the ARIMA model**.

## Project Objectives:

The project aims to answer the following research questions:
*   What are the trends in GHG emissions across different sectors in New Zealand? 
*   Is there a relationship between tourism and CO2 emissions in New Zealand? 
*   How do predictions for the next eight years on surface temperature, sea level rise, GHG emissions, and climate-related disasters look? 

## Data Sources:

*   Our World in Data: Global annual Greenhouse Gas emissions, Global annual CO2 emissions by Countries, Greenhouse gas emissions by sector in New Zealand.  
*   New Zealand Government Data Catalogue: New Zealand Tourism Forecasts.
*   IMF Climate Change and Stats NZ: Annual surface temperature change, Change in Mean Sea Levels, Climate-related disaster frequency, Gross GHG emissions.

All the datasets with link are available in [project doc]()

## Tools Used:

*   Excel
*   Python
*   Orange

## Analysis:

The project uses various data analysis techniques to answer the research questions. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the data and identify trends. Correlation and regression analysis are used to examine the relationships between the dependent and independent variables. Predictive modeling using the ARIMA model is used to forecast future climate scenarios.

## Results:

The project results show that:

*   GHG emissions from the agriculture and transportation sectors are the highest in New Zealand.

## Conclusion:

The project concludes that climate change is a severe issue in New Zealand. The country needs to take urgent action to reduce GHG emissions and promote sustainable tourism practices. The project results can be used by policymakers to develop strategies to address climate change.

## Recommendations:

The project recommends that New Zealand policymakers:

*   Promote sustainable tourism practices. 
*   Reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture and transportation sectors.
*   Invest in renewable energy sources.
*   Implement policies to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

## Project Impact:

This project can significantly impact New Zealand's climate change policies. The results can be used to inform policymakers and the public about the importance of taking action on climate change. Moreover, it can also help promote sustainable tourism practices and reduce New Zealand's GHG emissions.

## Call to Action:

I urge you to take action on climate change today. You can start by reducing your carbon footprint and supporting businesses that are committed to sustainability. You can also contact your elected officials and urge them to take action on climate change.
