Scenario:

You work as an analyst at a research center called DataTell. DataTell has three offices across New Zealand, with headquarters located in Auckland. Currently, there are 45 analysts working at DataTell. Seven of those analysts are senior analysts, including you.

In July 2023, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade (MFAT) created an opportunity for research centers around New Zealand to submit research that can help MFAT in achieving its strategic goal related to “Environment and Climate Change: Promote sustainable international solutions to global environment and natural resource challenges that impact on Aotearoa New Zealand.” MFAT requires that the research should employ at least descriptive statistics (in Python), correlation analysis (in Python), and data mining (in Excel and Orange) and include at least 30 observations.


**Objectives:**
1. Analysing the overall trend of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions across different sectors of New Zealand.
2. Is there a relationship between tourism and carbon emissions in New Zealand?
3.Considering the historical surface temperature, rise in sea level, GHG emissions, and other climate-related disasters, how does the prediction look for the next eight years, and how can the insights be used to prioritise environmental policies and resource allocations?


**Data-Analytics-R2** is the main document which consists of all the analysis and information.
