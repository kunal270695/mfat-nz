**Scenario:
**
You work as an analyst at a research center called DataTell. DataTell has three offices across New Zealand, with headquarters located in Auckland. Currently, there are 45 analysts working at DataTell. Seven of those analysts are senior analysts, including you.

In July 2023, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade (MFAT) created an opportunity for research centers around New Zealand to submit research that can help MFAT in achieving its strategic goal related to “Environment and Climate Change: Promote sustainable international solutions to global environment and natural resource challenges that impact on Aotearoa New Zealand.” MFAT requires that the research should employ at least descriptive statistics (in Python), correlation analysis (in Python), and data mining (in Excel and Orange) and include at least 30 observations.
